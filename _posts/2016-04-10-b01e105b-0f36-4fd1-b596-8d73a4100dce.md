Be prepared to get some awesome content from none other than John Schaser (aka: The\_Health\_Alchemist). In this blog I will give health tips, knowledge from my own decade long health journey, and me tearing apart the fallacies of the Health & Fitness industry. Yup it's going to be fun. 

**ABOUT:**

Since I was 12 fitness has been a major part of my life. That is why I want to take my life passion and utilize it to help others. The Health Alchemist is a named I coined after many experiments I have performed on myself. I never recommend anything to my friends or clients without experimenting and trying it myself. All of the products I recommend are tested and will be beneficial to your health and overall well-being.
